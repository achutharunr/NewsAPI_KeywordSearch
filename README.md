# NewsAPI_KeywordSearch
Shiny app that takes a keyword as input and returns most relevant news articles sourced via an API call to https://newsapi.org/

- If you maintain the same folder structure as in the repo, running **run.R** should open up the Shiny app directly
- Code is commented wherever possible to ensure ease of use for a new user
